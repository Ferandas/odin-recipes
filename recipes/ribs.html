        <li>4 Pounds of baby back pork ribs</li>
        <li>4 Cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 chili sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>1 clove crushed garlic</li>
      </ol>

    <h2 class="step">Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place ribs on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Scatter 4 cloves of 
            sliced garlic over ribs. Cover, and bake for 2 1/2 hours. Cool slightly.</li>
        
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together white sugar, paprika, salt, black pepper, chili powder, and ground cumin. Rub spices 
            over cooled ribs. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.</li>
        
        <li>In a small saucepan, mix together brown sugar, cider vinegar, ketchup, chili sauce, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, 
            onion, dry mustard, and 1 clove garlic. Simmer over medium-low heat, uncovered, for 1 hour. Reserve a small amount for 
            basting; the remainder is a dipping sauce.</li>
        
        <li>Preheat grill for medium heat.</li>    
        
        <li>Place ribs on grill. Grill, covered, for about 12 minutes, basting with the reserved sauce, until nicely browned and 
            glazed. Serve with remaining sauce for dipping.</li>
      </ol>
